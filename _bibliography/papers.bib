  abstract={The human aging brain is characterized by changes in network efficiency that are currently best captured through longitudinal resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). These studies however are challenging due to the long human lifespan. Here we show that the mouse animal model with a much shorter lifespan allows us to follow the functional network organization over most of the animal's adult lifetime. We used a longitudinal study of the functional connectivity of different brain regions with rs-fMRI under anesthesia. Our analysis uncovers network modules similar to those reported in younger mice and in humans (i.e., prefrontal/default mode network (DMN), somatomotor and somatosensory networks). Statistical analysis reveals different patterns of network reorganization during aging. Female mice showed a pattern akin to human aging, with de-differentiation of the connectome, mainly due to increases in connectivity of the prefrontal/DMN cortical networks to other modules. Our male cohorts revealed heterogenous aging patterns with only one group confirming the de- differentiation, while the majority showed an increase in connectivity of the somatomotor cortex to the Nucleus accumbens. In summary, in line with human work, our analysis in mice supports the concept of de-differentiation in the aging mammalian brain and reveals additional trajectories in aging mice networks.},

  abstract={Sexual abuse (SA) is known for its effects on brain structures in adolescents. We aimed to explore if SA has any effect on limbic and prefrontal cortex (PFC) structures. We hypothesized that children with SA would have a thinner PFC with larger amygdala and hippocampus that lead to aberrations in threat detection, orientation and response circuit; that would be highly adaptive in a dangerous environment in the short term. We included 57 SA and 33 healthy control (HC) female participants. In addition to psychiatric evaluation, we acquired 3 T MR images from all participants. We compared prefrontal cortical thicknesses, hippocampus and amygdala volumes between groups. SA participants had larger right and left hippocampus and right amygdala volumes than the controls. SA group had reduced inferior frontal gyrus cortical thickness than HC group. Children with SA history has structural abnormalities in threat detection, orientation and response circuit.},

  abstract={From observations in rodents, it has been suggested that the cellular basis of learning-dependent changes, detected using structural MRI, may be increased dendritic spine density, alterations in astrocyte volume, and adaptations within intracortical myelin. Myelin plasticity is crucial for neurological function, and active myelination is required for learning and memory. However, the dynamics of myelin plasticity and how it relates to morphometric-based measurements of structural plasticity remains unknown. We used a motor skill learning paradigm in male mice to evaluate experience-dependent brain plasticity by voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in longitudinal MRI, combined with a cross-sectional immunohistochemical investigation. Together, these observations indicate a nonlinear increase of intracortical myelin during learning and support the hypothesis that myelin is a component of structural changes observed by VBM during learning.},

  abstract={To study the aging human brain requires significant resources and time. Thus, mice models of aging can provide insight into changes in brain biological functions at a fraction of the time when compared to humans. This study aims to explore changes in dopamine D1 and D2 receptor availability and of gray matter density in striatum during aging in mice and to evaluate whether longitudinal imaging in mice may serve as a model for normal brain aging to complement cross-sectional research in humans. Mouse [11C]Raclopride data is compatible with previous reports in human cross-sectional studies, suggesting that a natural loss of dopaminergic D2 receptors in striatum can be assessed in mice, reflecting estimates from humans.},

  abstract={Although it is generally accepted that negative symptoms of schizophrenia are associated with larger lateral ventricles, this general assumption could not be validated in patients with primary negative symptoms. To elucidate this issue, we conducted a five-year longitudinal study, including deficit (n = 13) and non-deficit (n = 26) schizophrenia patients with healthy controls (n = 18). Analysis with linear mixed effects modeling showed that both the left and the right lateral ventricles of the deficit patients enlarged more than the non-deficit patients. Our results suggest that structural alterations in deficit patients might follow a different trajectory than those in non-deficit patients.},

  abstract={Previous structural brain-imaging studies in first-degree relatives of depressed patients showed alterations that are generally accepted as vulnerability markers for depression. However, only half of the relatives had depression at follow-up, while the other half did not. The aim of this study was to identify the brain areas associated with resilience to depression in high-risk subjects with familial depression. The analysis showed larger amygdala volume, thicker subcallosal cortex and bilateral insula in the women in the HRG compared with those in the depressive group. The larger gray matter volume and increased cortical thickness in the key hub regions of the salience network (amygdala and insula) and structurally connected regions in the limbic network (subcallosal area and temporal pole) might prevent women in the HRG from converting to depression.},

  abstract={The majority of the research studying the prefrontal region has focused on gray matter injury. However, recent studies show that damage to white matter also contributes to the development of cognitive impairment after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Through the use of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), it is now possible to assess the white matter fiber pathways between brain regions. White matter damage in TBI can cause dysfunction of different brain regions through disruption of connections with the traumatized area. In this case report, we emphasized that symptoms were not limited with dysfunction of the traumatized region and the regular functions of other brain regions were also affected via the disturbance of connection pathways.},

  abstract={An evolving literature suggests a volume reduction and a loss of functional integrity of prefrontal cortex in depressed patients. Interhemispheric prefrontal functional integrity is mediated via the anterior portion of the corpus callosum. In this study, we compared the corpus callosum area of depressed patients with controls using a novel schema proposed by Hofer and Frahm (2006) which defined a specific anterior callosal area for prefrontal interhemispheric fibers. Depressed patients had reduced prefrontal cortical volume and a loss of the normal callosal/gray matter correlation, but normal white matter volume and normal callosal areas. Our results indicate that the normal structural relationship between anterior callosal area and prefrontal cortical volume is disrupted in major depressive disorder and that the disruption is due to reduced cortical volume rather than to changes in interhemispheric connections.},

The deficit syndrome is the condition defined by the existence of primarily negative symptoms, and patients with the deficit syndrome differ from non-deficit patients on measures of brain structure and function. In the current study, by using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we investigated the frontotemporal connectivity that is hypothesized to differ between deficit and non-deficit schizophrenia. The fractional anisotropy values in the left uncinate fasciculus of schizophrenia patients with the deficit syndrome were lower than those of non-deficit patients and the controls. These findings provide evidence of left uncinate fasciculus damage resulting in disrupted communication between orbitofrontal prefrontal areas and temporal areas in deficit schizophrenia patients.},
