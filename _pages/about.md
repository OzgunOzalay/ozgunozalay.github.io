I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the [Blackford Emotional Neuroscience Lab](https://blackfordlab.com/) at the [Munroe-Meyer Institute (UNMC-MMI)](https://www.unmc.edu/mmi/).


I am especially interested in brain connectivity and network dynamics. I aim to understand how different brain regions work together and evolve as we grow, face challenges, and learn new things.

Recently, I have been exploring the fascinating world of large language models (LLMs). I am enthusiastic about AI's potential to enhance neuroscience research, provide clinical insights, and utilize data-driven discoveries.

If you're interested in neuroscience or the role of AI in research, I'd love to hear from you! Feel free to reach out with insights, questions, or collaboration ideas.
