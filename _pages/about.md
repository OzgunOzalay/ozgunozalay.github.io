Hello! I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the [Blackford Emotional Neuroscience Lab](https://blackfordlab.com/) at the [Munroe-Meyer Institute (UNMC-MMI)](https://www.unmc.edu/mmi/). My passion lies in uncovering the brain's connection patternsâ€”one link at a time!


I am particularly interested in brain connectivity and network dynamics, striving to comprehend how different brain areas collaborate and evolve as we grow, encounter challenges, and acquire new knowledge.


Recently, I've been exploring the captivating realm of large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). I'm truly enthusiastic about AI's potential to enrich neuroscience research, offer clinical insights, and facilitate data-driven discoveries.
